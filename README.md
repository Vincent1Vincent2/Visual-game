# Visual Escape Game

This is a game for a school project in my javascript basic course. It's an escape styled game where you have to find keys to get out.

In the game i've put a lock-picking mini game, a working iPod** and also a working piano keyboard.

All assets where created by me in figma

## Structure, Process and DLC development 

I wanted to make a visual game and knew i wanted to do it by hiding and showing imgs. It's built really simple and once i was done i knew i wanted to add more depth.
This is how the game development procces went. I finished the game and would then add more and more...


The first time the game was finished you only clicked buttons and i didn't have any real interactble objects besides clicking keys and doors.

- Lock pick DLC
The lock pick mini game was the first addition or dlc to the game. Once you click the lockpick you can choose what door you want to try and pick.
It opens with an explenation how you play the game and once you click start a count down from 13 starts. You then need to find three acces points
placed around the circle. Once you found all three you win.

- Piano DLC
  Once you've found the note sheet from the red room, you can go back to the brown room and use the piano. The piano was the second dlc and is a digital piano keybord.

- iPod DLC
  The iPod can be found in the blue room along with the red key. It's a digital iPod classic 5th gen. I just wanted a way to more of my personality to the project.
  There is a funny video, one music track and funny memes.
